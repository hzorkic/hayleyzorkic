      <description>0. BackgroundFrom the original authors of the dataset: “These are data from one of the first successful trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer. Levamisole is a low-toxicity compound previously used to treat worm infestations in animals; 5-FU is a moderately toxic (as these things go) chemotherapy agent. There are two records per person, one for recurrence and one for death.” This porject will explore the follwoing variables AT THE TIME OF DEATH from the colon dataset:Categorical (2-5 groups)- rx Treatment : Obs(ervation), Lev(amisole), Lev(amisole)+5-FU- differ Differentiation of tumour : 1=well, 2=moderate, 3=poor- extent Extent of local spread : 1=submucosa, 2=muscle, 3=serosa, 4=contiguous structures- sex (binary) : 1=male- obstruct (binary) obstruction of colon by tumour : 1=yesNumeric (more than 10 values)- age (numeric) : in years- time (numeric) days until death- nodes (numeric) number of lymph nodes with detectable cancerAfter omitting NA;s, 888 unique partient observations were left.</description>
