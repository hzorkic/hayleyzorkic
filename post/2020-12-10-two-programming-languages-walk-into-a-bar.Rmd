# Two Programming Lanugages Walk Into A Bar

![](/post/2020-12-10-two-programming-languages-walk-into-a-bar_files/two-cocktails.jpg)

## 0. Introduction

Two programming languages walk into The Computation, a new bar in town. Python, a smooth, popular language struts in and nods to the scholars and professionals. They swoon over discussions about everything from machine learning to web development. With a slight delay, R nonchalantly walks in over to its usual spot- next to the Academics and statisticians- surrounded by premade pacakges and libraries. 

Python and R walk up to the bartender at the same time while the other bar go-ers gasp and fall silent. The bartender sweats- how could he serve both Python and R at the same time? 

"I got it," croakes Reticulate, "both of 'em." 

Reticulate is an R package that allows for the simmotaneous usage of R and Python. In this post, I will teach you how to install reticulate, use it to interpolate between the two languages, and also explore string searching with Regular Expressions in R and Python /together./

## 1. Downloading Reticulate

First we want to install the reticulate package and load it in. Reticulate will use the version of python found on your PATH. If you would like to change it, you can use the use_python() function below.

```{R, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

## 2. How to switch between Python and R

Now that we have reticulate installed and loaded, we can run python chunks in R Markdown files by simply replaceing {R} with {python}.

Let's first utilize an R chuck to load in and wrangle a list of recipes of the cocktails offered at The Computation Bar:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

cocktails <- read.csv("cocktails.csv")
cocktails <- data.frame(cocktails) %>% select(-c(1,3,4,5,7,8,9,19,20:35)) 
head(cocktails) 
```

Nice! We have a dataset with a list of drinks, their category, and a list of required ingredients!R and Python are in the mood for a Rum based drink, but there are several types of Rum. We can use a python chunk and import the python regular expressions library to help us make a new dataset with only Rum based drinks.

```{python}
import re
import pandas as pd

cocktails = r.cocktails

cocktails['Ingredients'] = cocktails[['strIngredient1', 'strIngredient2','strIngredient3', 'strIngredient4', 'strIngredient5', 'strIngredient6', 'strIngredient7', 'strIngredient8', 'strIngredient9']].apply(lambda x: ', '.join(x[x.notnull()]), axis = 1)

df = cocktails[['strDrink','strCategory','Ingredients']]

#filter drinks with Rum in them
df = df[df['Ingredients'].str.contains("rum")]

print("There are",len(df),"drinks with Rum in them.",'\n')

#randomly select two drinks for Python and Rum
x = df.sample(n=1,replace=True)
y = df.sample(n=1,replace=True)
print("Python can order menu item ",x['strDrink'],'\n')
print("R can order menu item ",y['strDrink'],'\n')
```
